description: In-app payments, billing, and webhooks with Paddle.

next-forge-paddle uses [Paddle](https://paddle.com/) by default for payments and billing. Implementing Paddle in your project is straightforward.

## In-App Purchases

You can use Paddle anywhere in your app by importing the `paddle` object like so:

```ts page.tsx {1,5}
import { paddle } from '@repo/payments';

// ...

await paddle.prices.list();
```

## Webhooks

Paddle webhooks are handled in the `POST /webhooks/paddle` route in the `api` app. This route constructs the event and then switches on the event type to determine how to process the event.

### Local Development

To test webhooks locally you will need to create a http tunnel to your local server. We recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for this.

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:3002
```

This will create a public URL that you can use to test the webhook. You can then update the webhook URL in the Paddle dashboard to use this new URL.
